## **Record Overall Turnout?**

It appears likely that around 100 million early votes will be cast by the time Tuesday morning reports are processed. These reports will include early voting activity from the proceeding day. It is also likely reports by Tuesday morning will fail to capture all of the pre-election voting activity since there are sporadic reports of election officials experiencing delays in processing the unprecedented number of mail ballots. Furthermore, many states continue to accept mail ballots if they are postmarked on or before Election Day, as noted in this [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/27/upshot/election-results-timing.html). This report does not accurately describe mail ballot return deadlines for military and overseas civilian voters, which can be later than domestic voters.

What does this mean for overall turnout, including Election Day voters?

Before answering this question, let me first reiterate something very important about how to make forecasts with these data. The approach I use is known as difference-in-difference. In the election context, this technique makes a comparison to a past comparable election and then forecasts based on the current election. 

For example, in 2016 40% of the vote was cast early (this is a reasonable estimate of all early voting activity in 2016). If nothing changed, knowing the current estimate of 100 million early votes we could forecast 100 million/40% = 250 million votes will be cast in the election. Now, that is a ridiculously high number and we will not come close since it would be higher than the 239 million people [I estimate](http://www.electproject.org/2020g) are eligible to vote!

The obvious reason why an estimate of 40% of the vote will be cast early is wrong is that something changed. Does this mean that we cannot know anything from the early vote? No. There are some states where there is a good past comparison because they did not change their elections significantly or where we can make educated guesses about what the early vote is telling us.

One strong signal is that turnout will be higher than in 2016, because some states have already exceeded their 2016 turnout or are close to doing so.

| State         | % 2016 Total Vote |
| ------------- |-------------:|
| Hawaii         | 111% |
| Texas         | 108% |
| Montana       | 99% |
| North Carolina | 95% |
| Georgia | 94% |
| New Mexico | 93% |
| Nevada | 91% |
| Tennessee |90% |
| Oregon | 88% |
| Colorado | 87% |
| Arizona | 87% |
| New Jersey | 80% |

To forecast the 2020 turnout, the big unknowns are (in temporal order):

* How many early votes are left to be cast?
* How much Election Day vote there will be? 
* How many legally cast mail ballots postmarked on or before Election Day will arrive afterwards (which depends on states' ballot return deadlines)? 

I've been [saying for over a year](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/2020-election-voter-turnout-could-be-record-breaking/591607/) that 2020 could see record turnout for a modern election. More recently, I've been using a 150 million turnout estimate as a shorthand to convey that this number is just that, an estimate. Now that more early vote data are available, I'm ready to make a more concrete prediction.

Examining each state in turn, and rolling up the state estimates to a national estimate, I arrive at a total turnout rate of 160.2 million votes, or a turnout rate for those [eligible to vote](http://www.electproject.org/2020g) of 67.0%.

Regrettably, I have signed a non-disclosure agreement with the national exit poll organization that prevents me from going into greater detail about state turnout estimates, as I have in past years. I will be allowed to post estimates late on election night, which I will continue to update in the days afterwards as results are reported. This 


**Outstanding Mail Ballots**

As of this writing, there are **`r format(as.numeric(sum(state_stats$mail_sent_req_2020) - sum(state_stats$mail_accept_2020)), big.mark =",")`** outstanding mail ballots that have not been entered as returned by election officials.  

There are many unknowns with the outstanding mail ballots, so it is difficult to take these numbers at face value.

Factors in favor of the outstanding mail ballots being an over-count:

* Some mail ballots are in transit. 
* Some states continue to accept mail ballots if postmarked by Election Day.
* Some are at election offices but have not been entered into their databases. 
* It is unclear how election officials manage data for voters who requested a mail ballot, but decided to cast an in-person vote.

Factors in favor of the outstanding mail ballots being an under-count:

* Some states do not report mail ballot applications or the number of ballots sent; Texas probably being the largest of these states.
* Although not affecting the total number, the mail ballot return rate is too high in states where in-person votes are co-mingled with mail ballots; states like Iowa, among others.

Election officials in many states have never had to process so many mail ballots, so reporting delays and inconsistencies in reporting are understandable. When there were only tens of thousands of mail ballots statewide in some of these states, it was relatively easy to process the ballots and no one really cared about the few where someone may vote in-person. Increase the workload by two orders of magnitude, and delays will happen. Add to this the uncertainties with the post office driving more people to decide to vote in-person. We're making do in tough times with a poorly-funded election infrastructure in many places.
